        <p class="text-center mt-5 first">HONOLULU, HAWAII - A crew returned from the northernmost islands in the Hawaiian archipelago this week with a boatload of marine plastic and abandoned fishing nets that threaten to entangle endangered Hawaiian monk seals and other animals on the
            uninhabited beaches stretching nearly 2,100 kilometers north of Honolulu. The cleanup effort in Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument lasted three weeks and the crew picked up more than 43 metric tons of "ghost nets" and other marine
            plastics such as buoys, crates, bottle caps and cigarette lighters from the shores of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The monument, the largest protected marine reserve in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world, is in the northern
            Pacific Ocean and surrounded by what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — a huge gyre of floating plastic and other debris that circulates in ocean currents. The islands act like a comb that gather debris on its otherwise pristine
            beaches. The ecosystem in the monument is diverse, unique and one of the most intact marine habitats on Earth. But the beaches are littered with plastic and nets that ensnare endangered Hawaiian monk seals — of which there are only about 1,400
            left in the world — and green turtles, among other wildlife. </p>
        <p class="text-center mt-5 second">JOHANNESBURG - Anxious residents of the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius stuffed fabric sacks with sugar cane leaves Saturday to create makeshift oil spill barriers as tons of fuel leaking from a grounded ship put endangered wildlife in
            further peril. The government has declared an environmental emergency and France said it was sending help from its nearby Reunion island. Satellite images showed a dark slick spreading in the turquoise waters near wetlands that the government
            called "very sensitive." "When biodiversity is in peril, there is urgency to act," French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted Saturday. Wildlife workers and volunteers ferried dozens of baby tortoises and rare plants from an island near the
            spill, Ile aux Aigrettes, to the mainland as fears grew that worsening weather on Sunday could tear the Japanese-owned ship apart along its cracked hull. A French statement from Reunion on Saturday said a military transport aircraft was carrying
            pollution control equipment to Mauritius and a navy vessel with additional material would head for the island nation. </p>
        <p class="text-center mt-5 third ">All the water we have is all the water we will have. It is the same water since the dawn of creation responsible for the birth and re-birth of life on earth. A ‘once-use and dispose’ mindset is simply not sustainable. Humanity is draining the
            land and treating waterways as waste dumps with widespread devastation. We must Close-the-Loop on the shoddy, inefficient, costly way we treat water and return the natural water cycle to the land, if we seek to counteract the effects of climate
            change.
